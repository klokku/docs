## About this documentation

This documentation works for both the managed Klokku service at https://app.klokku.com and the self-hosted version, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

By default, it shows URLs for the managed service, but you can set the URL to point to your self-hosted instance here, so it displays the correct links:

<KlokkuUrlOverride client:load defaultUrl={klokkuUrl}/>
