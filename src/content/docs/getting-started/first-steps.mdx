## Create a user profile
The first thing you need to do is create a user profile.\
Klokku requires some basic information about you to function properly.

## Define budget plan

A **budget plan** defines how much time you want to allocate to a specific activity, group of activities, or project.
For each budget item, you need to specify how much time you plan to dedicate to it every week.
Common examples of budget items include:
- Sleep
- Work
- Study
- Personal
- Family
- Sport
- Other (more on that later)

Your total of 168 hours per week should be divided among all your budget items.

There is one special — the **other** budget item. You can rename it if you wish.
This item is used to track any time not covered by your other budget items. It’s essential because, for most people, it’s unrealistic to plan for every hour of the week.

When you sign in to Klokku for the first time, you can start with a setup wizard like this:

This wizard will guide you through the process of defining your budget plan.

:::tip[Tips for defining budget items]
- Distribute all 168 hours of your week across budget items
- Avoid creating too many or overly specific budget items — 10–12 is usually enough to start
- Assign at least 10 hours per week to the **other** budget item — you may be surprised how much time goes into unplanned activities

## Choose the current budget plan item

Now it’s time to choose your current budget item. Whenever you start a new activity, select the plan item that best matches what you’re doing.
This provides Klokku with the data it needs to generate insights, helping you understand where your time goes and making it easier to plan ahead.

There are two ways to choose your current item:
- The always-visible dropdown on the top bar
- Current plan item card on the dashboard

Keeping track of the current budget manually might be hard. Klokku offers a way to automate this process. \
