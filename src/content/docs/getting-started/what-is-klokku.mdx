## What is Klokku?

Klokku is a **personal time tracking application** designed to help you understand how you spend your time and make realistic plans within your available hours. Unlike productivity apps that promise to make you more efficient, Klokku focuses on helping you plan what can actually get done in a limited amount of time.

## Core Philosophy
Klokku doesn't promise to make you more productive. Instead, it helps you:
- Understand where your time actually goes
- Plan realistically within your time constraints
- Make informed decisions about time allocation
- Maintain balance in your daily routine

## Key Features

### Time Budgeting
Create time budget items for different areas of your life. Allocate specific amounts of time to various task groups and activities, helping you think strategically about how you want to spend your time.

### Weekly Planning Adjustments
Life is unpredictable. Klokku allows you to adjust your weekly plans to keep them realistic and achievable. This ensures you don't overcommit while reserving time for what truly matters to you.

### Automated Tracking
Track your time manually or use automations to update your current activity. Klokku integrates with various tools to automatically switch your active budget item based on what you're working on.
