Keeping your current budget item up to date is essential in Klokku, but doing it manually can get tedious.

To help, Klokku provides several interfaces you can use to automate budget item changes based on external events:

- REST API
- [Home Assistant integration](/docs/integrations/home-assistant-integration)
- [Incoming webhooks](/docs/integrations/incoming-webhooks)

This section includes examples showing how to use these interfaces from external applications.
